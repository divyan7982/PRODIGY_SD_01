# Temperature Converter Program

## Project Description

This Temperature Converter program was developed in C++ during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Features

- Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface.
- Handles various input scenarios, including invalid inputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, MSVC, etc.)
- Any standard C++ IDE or text editor (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/divyan7982/PRODIGY_SD_01.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd PRODIGY_SD_01
    ```

### Compiling and Running the Program

1. **Compile the Code:**

    ```bash
    g++ temperature-converter-program.cpp -o temperature-converter-program
    ```

2. **Run the Executable:**

    ```bash
    ./temperature-converter-program
    ```

## Usage

- Once the program is running, follow the on-screen prompts to input a temperature and choose the desired conversion.
- The program will display the converted temperature based on your input.
